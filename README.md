# Neural Network Stock Price Prediction App

## Overview

This repository hosts a stock price prediction application leveraging a neural network model. The application, built with Python, TensorFlow, and Streamlit, provides an interactive platform for users to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Features

- **Neural Network Prediction**: Utilizes a trained neural network to forecast stock prices.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: The application is powered by Streamlit, offering a user-friendly, interactive interface.
- **Data Visualization**: Features visualizations of historical stock prices alongside predictive data, aiding in trend analysis and decision-making.

## Models

The neural network model is detailed in the `Models/NN.py` notebook. This notebook outlines the model's architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics. The final model is saved as `Models/NN.keras`, which the Streamlit application uses for making predictions.
